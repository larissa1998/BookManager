# REST API in C# with .NET 8

This project is a RESTful API developed in C# using .NET 8, following the principles of Clean Architecture to ensure a modular, scalable, and maintainable structure.

The API includes a secure authentication system using JWT tokens and applies password encryption to protect user credentials. It also implements the CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) pattern to improve performance and maintainability. Code quality is ensured through unit tests implemented with XUnit.

# Key Features
✅ RESTful API → Follows the REST standard for efficient client-server communication.

✅ Clean Architecture → Well-structured layers for easier maintenance and expansion.

✅ CQRS Pattern → Separates commands (write operations) and queries (read operations) for better scalability and performance.

✅ JWT Authentication → Secure authentication system using JSON Web Tokens.

✅ Password Encryption → User passwords are securely stored.

✅ Unit Testing with XUnit → Automated tests ensure code functionality and integrity.
